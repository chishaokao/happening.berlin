Description: For nearly 40 years, Paul Graham’s work has presented an unflagging commitment to depicting life as it unfolds. He first established his reputation in the early 1980s by introducing the practice of color photography into the classic genre of “social documentary.” Since then, Graham has turned his lens towards seemingly incidental, fleeting moments, capturing life in passing as an endless flow of time rather than an isolated or static instant. Graham himself has claimed that the photography that he most respects “pulls something out of the ether of nothingness” and over four decades of his rich and layered practice, Graham has cultivated this ethos.
