Description: Galerie Max Hetzler is pleased to announce the solo exhibition ut the Clouds Never Hung So Low Before ith recent paintings by eleste Dupuy-Spencer t Goethestra e 2/3. This is the artistâ€™s first solo exhibition outside of the USA, and with the gallery.Celeste Dupuy-Spencer creates blistering paintings, loaded with a complex mix of iconography, drawn from the real and the imaginary. The artist grapples with urgent and fundamental issues through the symbolic and at times historical nature of its subjects. Both unflinching and empathic, Dupuy-Spencer gives life to arresting compositions that can be bleak and troubling, at times softer and endearing, in which the worldly and the extraordinary, the holy and the base, merge to present a multitude of possible meanings and narratives.
