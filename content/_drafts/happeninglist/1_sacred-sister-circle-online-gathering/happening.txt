Description: Beautiful Shaktis,          This is an experience for women to rise in connection, support and celebration of one another.           Welcome home.  About this Event          								          									                    	Beautiful Sister,Are you also over this current separation disease. Do you crave being with your like-minded tribe, meet new inspiring soul sisters and simple thrive in authentic connection? Now more than ever. This is an experience for women to rise in connection, support and celebration of one another. This Sacred Sister Circle is a 2 hour gathering of women, (virtually) to engage in meaningful conversation about our hearts, lives, and vision for the planet. Experience a sacred safe space of women where the whole of you is welcomed, just as you are.This sacred sister circle will be a nurturing, accepting environment to share your unique truths and to allow yourself to be seen, heard and understood by women who get you. We value every woman's uniqueness. We understand it is not our job to fix anyone else, but instead celebrate and honour them and their unique journey. You will be led by Chi Lisa Schulz who brings this ceremonial gathering to her community as she has been living and experiencing it in her second home  Bali. Mama Bali is the embodiment of community and walking through life together. You can expect:- welcome & intentions- meditation- sharing circle- closing Thank you for helping us create more sisterhood in our world! Together we shall rise. When women come together in circles they come HOME.  I am looking forward to seeing you in the circle.Namaste, Sister.Chi
