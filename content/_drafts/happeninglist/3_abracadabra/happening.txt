Description: Capitain Petzel is pleased to present an installation by Yael Bartana, consisting of her new typographic work bracadabra nd the ever-relevant neon REMBLING TIMES.Yael Bartana's new poster series bracadabra eintroduces an ancient spell as a comment on the rise of superstition and conspiracy theories. The art work addresses both a fictional alternative way to "fight" the current global pandemic, and the rise of new movements denying scientific facts. The Abracadabra spell was used throughout history in magical gestures and performances. The mysterious term "Abracadabra" first appears in the writings of Serenus Sammonicus, a medical savant who served as physician to several Roman Emperors. In his book, iber Medicinalis, Sammonicus suggests a literary amulet against fever and malaria: the word "Abracadabra" written in the form of a triangle. Though the etymological origin of the word is unclear, it may well have derived from the Hebrew "Evra KeDavra", literally meaning "I shall create with the use of speech", a reference to the creation of the world, accomplished   as described in the Hebrew Bible   merely through the use of words.
