Description: Galerie Guido W. Baudach is pleased to present an exhibition of new paintings by Thomas Helbig under the title ie Zukunft der Heiligen(The Future of the Saints). It is the eighth solo exhibition of the Berlin-based painter and sculptor with the gallery since 2001.In his painterly practice over the last twenty years, Thomas Helbig has repeatedly explored the boundaries of the genre. He has worked with a wide variety of materials, using the most diverse painting grounds and media. With the paintings for the exhibition ie Zukunft der Heiligen e is now returning to the technique he originally used. The works are all executed in oil on canvas. Helbig also draws on formative elements from his own early work in terms of pictorial language. What emerges, however, is something completely new. Helbig combines symbolic references to the classical avant-garde with abstract motifs that evoke associations with cosmic phenomena and at the same time recall the moonlit night skies of Romanticism - albeit in close-up. Seen purely from a painterly point of view, here multi-coloured underlaid areas of sulphurous pastel yellow enter into a relationship with softly layered brown tones and form a contrasting space of light and shadow that is both shimmering and interwoven with delicate sfumato.
