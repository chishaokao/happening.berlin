Description: Since February 2020, Jason Martin has dedicated himself to working on the preparation and evelopment of this new series of paintings. This group of works marks an important shift in he artistâ€™s practice: He returns to the paintbrush, but for the first time uses a versatile colour alette in different hues and tones to create paintings of immense depth and space.Looking at the polychrome paintings one journeys into something that begins on the surface, ut which then pulls you in deeper and deeper, opening into an unfathomable space beyond. ne reaches a surprising, almost figurative reality inside the painting, much like looking into a lazing fire, swirling water or ice. The lateral movement of the brushwork supports the multi-layered play of colours in the more translucent paintings, while others retain an opaqueness.
