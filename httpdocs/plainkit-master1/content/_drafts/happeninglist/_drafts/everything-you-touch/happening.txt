Description: Landscape is the work of the mind,” claimed the great historian Simon Schama. “Its scenery is built up as much from strata of memory as from layers of rock.” Be it an idyllic plain field or an obscure wasteland, landscapes are also reservoirs of references; our references, indistinguishable from our biographies. Landscapes may look beautiful and bright from a distance, like the very narrative we tell ourselves of who we are. But come closer and you’ll notice how injured and scarred its surface is, full of mysterious traces and unjustifiable marks. There’s more to a landscape than meets the eye.
