Titled ‘The women I know’, the show focuses on a new body of works consisting of four moving portraits of female friends in Amer’s signature embroidered painting style, along with a dramatic self-portrait in black and white. The exhibition also gathers a constellation of ceramics in an attempt to survey the artist’s most recent sculptural works.
