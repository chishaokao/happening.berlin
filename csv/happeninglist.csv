Response to Transient and Steady State Flickering Stimuli,Response to Transient and Steady State Flickering Stimuli,Thomas Zipp,Galerie Guido W. Baudach,"Thomas Zipp's exhibition for Gallery Weekend 2021 is conceived as a space-specific overall experience that brings together works of different media such as painting, sculpture and performance in an installation in situ. Titled Response to Transient and Steady State Flickering Stimuli, Zipp once again addresses functions of the human perceptual apparatus in relation to mental processes, as well as scientific approaches to their exploration beyond the academic mainstream.

Zipp negotiates these often complex theoretical contexts by creating transformational images, objects, and situations that are as concise as they are multi-layered. On the one hand, they are based on a profound examination of the respective subject matter, and on the other hand, they are developed from a vocabulary that is all his own, rhizome-like, linking the most diverse aspects of art and cultural history with the subject matter, for which he is widely known as an artist.

A good insight into Zipp's work, which now spans more than two decades, is provided by the recently published overview A23, the public presentation of which will take place in the course of the exhibition.",http://www.guidowbaudach.com/,29/04/2021,26/06/2021,Kreuzberg, Pohlstrasse 67,10785,exhibition,,,,

Le saint ennui,Le saint ennui,"Ethan  Assouline, 																		Guillaume  Dénervaud, 																		Garance  Früh, 																		Mona  Varichon",BQ,"Le saint ennui was inspired by the central character of Mr. Bougran’s retirement, a novel written in 1888 by the
multifaceted French novelist and art critic Joris-Karl Huysmans.

 


Resulting from an open dialogue between four artists whose practices address our normative modes of perception,
this exhibition brings together works offering a reflection on the mutability of reality, from a bodily to a societal
scale, from a sentimental to a political perspective.

 


In logic, the principle of non-contradiction states that a proposition and its opposite cannot coexist at the same time,
or on the same plane. In theory, reality cannot contradict itself. While this principle cannot be demonstrated, Mr.
Bougran seems fully determined to refute it.

 


Bougran is a middle-aged civil servant who is unfairly forced into early retirement by the administration he served
loyally for a number of years. His dismissal comes with the label “psychological infirmity undetectable by men of the
medical art”.",http://www.bqberlin.de/,08/06/2021,31/07/2021,Mitte, Weydingerstr. 10,10178,exhibition,,,,

Samson Young,,Samson Young,Capitain Petzel,"In the heart of artist and composer, Samson Young's (b. 1979 in Hong Kong) artistic practice are multicultural paradigms weaved into a symphony of image and sound. Young typically channels his attunement to music by pushing its formalist boundaries to create innovative cross-media experiences which address the topics of identity, war, and literature. In his first presentation at the gallery, Young deals with the actual physicality of a specific technological process. In 3D printing, a support structure helps to ensure the printability of a part, making the exhibited Support Structures a pertinent reference to the so-called age of progress we find ourselves in. The focus of Young’s exhibition lies in the praise of the very components of 3D printing technology, as he shifts from the notion of a structural necessity to a newly created reality.",http://www.capitainpetzel.de/,28/04/2021,19/07/2021,Mitte, Karl-Marx-Allee 45,10178,exhibition,,,,

This decades-long exploration across various media such as painting, film, sculpture, photography as well as perfomance art, has led him to establish his own subjective 5-part classification system, which he calls his “theory of the five worlds”, picked up again by this exhibition in which the main space of the gallery is divided into five walls, relating to his world system, and carrying works and processes from the last 50 years, as well as new works made for the occassion, ranging from rubbings to tapestries, from ceramics to flags, posters and more.",http://www.capitainpetzel.de/,28/04/2021,19/07/2021,Mitte, Karl-Marx-Allee 45,10178,exhibition,,,,

Williams’ practice, which has continually investigated the methods of production and contexts of display of images and objects, has always extended beyond art objects to their construction and presentation, often foregrounding the “secondary materials” of exhibitions and artworks, such as publications and promotional material.

The stone reliefs hover over a deep blue wall-to-wall carpet, a reference to a 90s industrial trade fair setting as a symbolic space of economic opportunity.

Diverse Enigmas,Diverse Enigmas,Brian  O’Doherty,Galerie Thomas Fischer c/o ANDREAS MURKUDIS,"„It’s a running joke with my dear friend, the nonagenarian artist-slash-everything, Brian O’Doherty: I tease him for being a ‚dirty conceptualist‘. This turn of phrase suggests a specific breed of aesthetic impurity. You see, by some accounts, the first generation of conceptual artists in New York were focused primarily on the idea of art made by thinking alone (hence their moniker). Yet, amongst that particular clique—whom O’Doherty exhibited with and even helped corral, most notably by editing and designing the milestone 1967 issue 5+6 of Aspen magazine on minimal and conceptual art—he stood out in multiple ways. For one, the polymathic O’Doherty’s work held the body and all its five senses dearly, in contrast to the coolly rational artistic currents of the 1960s. This insistence on the primacy of the embodied, holistic, and subjective aesthetic experience marks his works as different from other colleagues of that period, as well as signalling its continued relevance today.“

blew paint over them, creating these prints. The installation Second Planet 2021 casts

We Had Everything Before Us,We Had Everything Before Us,Adrian Ghenie,Galerie Judin,"With this exhibition of new paintings, Adrian Ghenie and Juerg Judin look back on 15 years of collaboration. It began in 2006 with the now legendary group exhibition The Cluj Connection, followed by a solo exhibition within a year – Ghenie's first appearance on the international scene. Since then, he has become one of the most successful painters of his generation – the first generation to grow up in the new age of the internet. Ghenie's response to this unprecedented flood of information, images and the technical ""anything goes"" was (and remains), his focus on the traditional, almost reactionary medium of painting. What distinguishes him from other figurative painters of his peer group is his profound understanding of art history, that never exhausted itself in citation, and an increasingly virtuoso play with different stages of recognizability.

 

Much has been written about Ghenie’s examination of the famous and the notorious of history who either led the way to the great evolutions of the 20th century (Charles Darwin, Vincent Van Gogh) – or were responsible for its great catastrophes (Hitler, Lenin). Their iconographic faces regularly merge with his own features in brilliant self-portraits. Now, in the ten paintings of the exhibition We Had Everything Before Us, all completed in the spring of 2021, Ghenie for the first time turns to his friends, neighbors and the buoyant pre-pandemic scenes of his home, Berlin. As the exhibition title suggests, the focus lies on the coming of age and the ensuing ""lack of history"". It is about the moment when life is thought of exclusively in the present and future tense and the past tense seems a long way off.",http://www.galeriejudin.com/,01/05/2021,10/07/2021,Kreuzberg, Potsdamer Straße 83,10785,exhibition,,,,
Von den ersten und den letzten Dingen,Von den ersten und den letzten Dingen,"Enrique Martinez Celaya, 																		Käthe  Kollwitz",Galerie Judin,"Enrique Martínez Celaya (*1964) was just a teenager when he first discovered German culture. It may seem surprising that an artist born in Cuba, who grew up in Spain and Puerto Rico and entirely outside the realm of German influence, is to this day so fascinated by the “Land of Poets and Thinkers.” Whereas most people would rate Nietzsche, Brecht and Hegel as heavy duty, this young Latino ravenously devoured the work of German writers and philosophers, and in so doing he stumbled across Käthe Kollwitz (1867–1945). The most famous female German artist of all, whose work is situated between Realism and Expressionism, became an elective affinity and an inspiration for his own “being an artist in this world.” For some years now, his older colleague (or at least one of her self-portraits, which now hangs in his studio) has looked over his shoulder as he works. Martínez Celaya shares this passion for Kollwitz with Gudrun and Martin Fritsch, who have promoted her oeuvre in two ways. The Berlin-based husband-and-wife team have not only built a significant collection of her art but were also managing the affairs of the private Käthe-Kollwitz-Museum in Berlin for many years. The Fritsch Collection served Martínez Celaya as a springboard for a cycle consisting of nine paintings, two works on paper, and a sculpture. Most of these works are adaptations of privotal drawings by Kollwitz that testify to her profound humanism and her desire to have a social impact. In times marked by a global pandemic and refugee crisis, Martínez Celaya brings her humanitarian message into the present with a new intensity. The result is a homage in a double sense: to the artist who played such a decisive part in his own artistic formation and to the two collectors who have made such a significant contribution to the knowledge and appreciation of her work.",http://www.galeriejudin.com/,13/07/2021,04/09/2021,Kreuzberg, Potsdamer Straße 83,10785,exhibition,,,,

SHEROES OF PHOTOGRAPHY | Part II: Tata Ronkholz,SHEROES OF PHOTOGRAPHY | Part II: Tata Ronkholz,,Kicken Berlin,"As the second part of its 2021 exhibition series Sheroes of photography Kicken Berlin is going to present an overview of the work of Tata Ronkholz (1940-1997) from April 30 to July 27, 2021. Alongside artists like Thomas Ruff, Candida Höfer and Thomas Struth, Ronkholz was among the first students of Bernd Becher at Düsseldorf Art Academy. Even before she enrolled in Bernd and Hilla Becher’s class, Ronkholz started working on her first black and white photographs of industrial sites which she pictured with a large format camera during wintertime for the most factual scenes without any disturbing vegetation. Her best known series is about the local Trinkhallen: these kiosks and small shops of the Rhine and Ruhr area so characteristic for social and neighborly everyday culture. At the same time as conceptual typological studies, Ronkholz’ photographs of these specific urban architectures which are subject to changes are important historical documents. Ronkholz spotted her characteristic motifs in the cities of Cologne, Düsseldorf, Bochum and other parts of the Rhine and Ruhr area.",http://www.kicken-gallery.com/,30/04/2021,13/08/2021,Charlottenburg, Kaiserdamm 118,14057,exhibition,,,,

In their paintings, photographs and installations, the internationally established and emerging artists show moments of confrontation with themselves, the alter ego or with traces of the past. “What mood did you find there?” is not just a classic interview question for artists who draw from their experiences, but also for visitors and protagonists in a work of art.

Malerei ist für Rokkaku ein körperlicher Akt. Sie appliziert die Acrylfarbe mit den Händen direkt auf die Leinwand und taucht so geradezu ein in ihre traumartigen Szenerien. Changierend zwischen Abstraktion und Figuration ergibt sich daraus nach und nach eine fantastische Landschaft, bewohnt von Tieren, Pflanzen oder Figuren, die mal frei durch den Raum schweben, mal im undefinierten Raum verwurzelt scheinen oder einfach im „Dazwischen“ verhaften.",http://www.koeniggalerie.com/,26/06/2021,25/07/2021,Kreuzberg, Alexandrinenstraße 118-121,10969,exhibition,,,,

Pillar of Salt,Pillar of Salt,Ella Littwitz,alexander levy,"Ella Littwitz’s works deal with issues informed by the political, social and cultural in nature, conceptualizing landscapes through no-man’s lands, transitions and removals. Her interest lies in the constant desire of humankind to draw limits, control nature, soil shift and landscape and make of all these sovereign ideologies. For the exhibition, Littwitz focuses on locations along the Southern part of the Jordan River, where the border between Jordan and Israel is along the water, where two tectonic plates collide, causing a constant shift of the terrain, where Jesus is believed to have been baptized and the Israelites entered the promised land. An area that is also called the land of pursuits. Littwitz’s works echo the Biblical and modern narratives associated with these areas, presenting us with diverse examples of transition, transfiguration and the formation of political constructs through acts of belief.",http://www.alexanderlevy.net/,29/04/2021,20/06/2021,Kreuzberg, Rudi-Dutschke-Str. 26,10969,exhibition,,,,
