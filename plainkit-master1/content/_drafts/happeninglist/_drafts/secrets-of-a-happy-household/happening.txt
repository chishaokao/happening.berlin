Description: DITTRICH & SCHLECHTRIEM is pleased to present SECRETS OF A HAPPY HOUSEHOLD, the first solo show with the gallery in Berlin by KATARINA JANECKOVA ALSHE (b. 1988 in Bratislava, Slovakia / lives and works in Corpus Christi, Texas, USA). The exhibition features large-scale oil and acrylic paintings on canvas as well s a series of works on paper and writings. Janeckova Walshe documents her life in various portraits and depictions of human and animal figures cast in mundane yet rovocative scenarios, with titles that are as fittingly descriptive as they are fraught such as Dishwashing In Texas III, Marriage Is a Choice, and What Did You Do All Day aby?. Expressive compositions of cowboys and bears or domestic interiors and scenes from intimate relationships are paired with self-portraits navigating open or bstacle-filled Texan landscapes, altogether conveying a blend of unvarnished truth and psychological fantasy.
